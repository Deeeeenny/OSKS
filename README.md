# An open-source key system made for Roblox Scripts.

**No need to pay $100s just for a key system. Just use OSKS (Open Source Key System) and with a bit of obfuscation you will be ready**

## Features

- Free & Open Source, You will know what is happening with very little Javascript knowledge
- Self-hostable, when this project goes down, or is deleted. You can self-host it. We have a guide and it is very easy to follow!
- Easily customisable, Since its free and open source, you can change it very easily.
- Very little maintance, Just add the lua loadstring, fork the repository. And your done.

## THIS IS NOT AN ALTERNATIVE TO OTHER SOLUTIONS, JUST A FREE WAY TO DO SO.

## Disadvantages
- Not server-side, not a whitelisting solution like [Lua Armor](https://luarmor.net/)
- Determined threat-actors can deobfuscate the code, therefore breaking the key system.
